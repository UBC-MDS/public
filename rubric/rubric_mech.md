## Grading Rubric for Mechanics ##

This rubric measures the student's ability to produce an assignment that *works correctly*; 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>No attempt (0)</th>
    <th>Poor (F)</th>
    <th>Unsatisfactory (D)</th>
    <th>Satisfactory (C- to C+)</th>
    <th>Good (B- to B+)</th>  
    <th>Excellent (A- to A+)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Evaluator was unable to run/open/read assignment submission despite best efforts.<br/><br/>This may be because the student forgot to include certain files in the submission or tailored the software to only work on their local machine (e.g. the code only works when run from a certain directory on the student's machine, contains paths to files only on the student's machine, etc.), or they did not submit their assignment correctly or completely, or it was unclear where the relevant parts of the assignment are included in the submission. </td>
    <td>Evaluator had to spend some time to get the raw submission to work correctly</td>
    <td></td> 
    <td>Evaluator had to make an obvious, small, quick fix to get things working. The wrong file or file format was submitted on Canvas/Gradescope, but there is evidence that the correct file was pushed to GitHub before the lab deadline (otherwise a late penalty will be applied).</td> 
    <td>The submission is self-contained and works flawlessly (in anybody's hands). <br></br> The student included all the files in the submission. <br></br> Any necessary libraries to install are either included or are installed by a script, or are made obvious that that the evaluator must install them. <br></br> Student used the asked for file format. All assignment instructions were followed.<br/><br/> All files were put in a repository, in a reasonable place, with reasonable names; any source files (.ipynb, .Rmd) are rendered to a readable output format (e.g. .pdf) where appropriate, all visualizations and images are included, there is a README file indicating where to find the different aspects of the assignment, etc.
