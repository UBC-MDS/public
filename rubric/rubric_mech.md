	<td>Evaluator was unable to run/open/read assignment submission despite best efforts.<br/><br/>This may be because the student forgot to include certain files in the submission or tailored the software to only work on their local machine (e.g. the code only works when run from a certain directory on the student's machine, contains paths to files only on the student's machine, etc.), or they did not submit their assignment correctly or completely, or it was unclear where the relevant parts of the assignment are included in the submission. </td>
    <td>Evaluator spent significant time in order to get the raw submission to work correctly</td>
    <td>Evaluator spent only a small amount of time to get the raw submission to work correctly</td>
    <td>The submission is self-contained and works flawlessly; any necessary libraries to install are either included or are installed by a script, or are made obvious that that the evaluator must install them. Student used commonly-used file formats such .pdf or .md or .Rmd and avoided using any potentially difficult-to-read file formats such as .docx, .xls, unless permisison was given by the evaluator in advance. The student did not forget to include all the files in the submission.</td>
<br/><br/>
All files were put in a repository, in a reasonable place, with reasonable names; any source files (.tex, .Rmd) are rendered to a readable output format (e.g. .pdf), all figures are included, there is a README file indicating where to find the different aspects of the assignment, etc.
