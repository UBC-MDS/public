  <tr>
    <td>Did not attempt.</td>
    <td>Code does not run.</td>
    <td>Code runs, but is inefficient enough that it can't be run to completion in a reasonable time frame.</td>
    <td>Code runs to completion, but is noticeably slower than it needs to be due to an implementation choice such as an inappropriate algorithm or failure to make proper use of an appropriate package or built-in function.</td>  
    <td>Code runs fairly well, but there are small optimizations that could have made it a bit faster.</td>
    <td>Code is as fast as it can reasonably be given the specifications of the problem.</td>
