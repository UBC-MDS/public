  <tr>
    <td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Code fails to run, doesn't have clear output, or performs the wrong task.</td>
    <td>Code performs only some/part of the correct task(s) and/or the output is not easily understandable.</td>
    <td>Code performs most of what is being asked for, and what it does right is discernible from the output</td>
    <td>Code performs the correct task(s) though there are subtle issues that result in a less than perfect output (perhaps only in some cases); the output is reasonably easy to understand.</td>
    <td>Code runs perfectly and the output is clear without being unnecessarily verbose.</td>
