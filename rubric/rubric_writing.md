<table>
  <tr>
  <th>No attempt (0)</th>
    <th>Poor (F)</th>
    <th>Unsatisfactory (D)</th>
    <th>Satisfactory (C- to C+)</th>
    <th>Good (B- to B+)</th>  
    <th>Excellent (A- to A+)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>Not Attempted</td>
	  <td>Meaning of text is obscured due to writing related issues such as significant grammar and spelling errors. <br></br> The submission is far too long (or far too short); word or sentence count significantly exceeded if one was given.</td>
    <td>Many grammatical and/or spelling errors are present (> 10/250 words), but the meaning of text is not significantly obscured by grammar or spelling errors.</td>
<br/><br/> The structure of the text is confusing and the reader may have to jump back and forth through the text. Any figures included are not labelled clearly or sensibly.
    <td>Several grammatical or spelling errors are present (5-10/250 words).</td>
<br/><br/> The structure of the text is somewhat clear. Paragraph delineation could be improved. Included figures labels need more clarity/could be better.
    <td>Few grammatical or spelling errors are present (2-5/250 words). <br></br> The submisison is not too long or too short; if there was a word or sentence count given, then it was not exceeded by any significant margin.</td>
<br/><br/> The structure of the text is clear and delineated sensibly into paragraphs. Included figures are labelled clearly and sensibly.
    <td>Almost no grammatical or spelling errors are present (< 2/250 words).<br></br>  The submission is concise and to the point; the word or sentence count was respected.</td>
<br/><br/> The structure of the text is impeccable; the reader never has to jump back and forth unless clearly instructed to do so by references.
