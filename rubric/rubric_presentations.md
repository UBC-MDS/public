  <tr>
    <th>Engagement & Clarity (40%)</th>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Speaker gives a presentation that is so short, shallow, or confusing that it was clear that no effort was made.</td>
    <td>Words are spoken quietly or the speaker does not enunciate so that few or no listeners can understand; speaker lacks enthusiasm; speaker pauses frequently and cannot remember what to say; speaker ignores the audience and never makes eye contact; speaker constantly reads off the slides.</td>
    <td>Speaker can make it through the presentation without significant stumbling; speaker mostly projects so that the evaluator can hear clearly; speaker occasionally makes eye contact with the audience.</td>
    <td>Speaker projects so that everyone can hear almost everything, although there may be a couple moments where the speaker trails off; speaker enunciates clearly with relatively few umms and ahhs; eye contact is fairly consistent, and body language is mostly natural and open; audience engagement has been a consideration when designing the presentation, although it might not be perfectly executed.</td>
    <td>Speaker projects so that everyone can hear throughout the whole presentation; speaker enunciates clearly and enthusiastically without mumbling or slurring; eye contact is held and body language is used to enhance the verbal presentation; the speaker can smile and entertain the audience; the speaker does not simply read off the slides; the time limit is respected; the speaker looks to the audience or even interacts with them in order to gauge their understanding and adjust the pace accordingly; audience engagement has been a priority in the presentation design, e.g. a captivating introduction or an interactive element during the presentation.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Use of Visuals (40%)</th>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Speaker missed all opportunities to enhance their presentation with visuals.</td>
    <td>Speaker designed some form of visuals, but doesn't follow any best practices. Visuals may have large blocks of text, unannotated graphs, jarring color schemes, or otherwise confusing designs. Slides may be riddled with typos.</td>
    <td>Speaker designed visuals that could have been useful as supplements to the presentation, but fails to use them effectively. (For example, graphs may be reasonably well-designed, but the speaker doesn't explain their axes or help the audience understand their messages.) Speaker may be distracted by their own visuals, or may inadvertently cause the visuals to compete with their own words for the audience's attention. There are multiple typos.</td>
    <td>Visuals are well designed, well explained, and almost always used to good effect. Fonts, colors, images, or whitespace could use minor improvements. There may be one or two typos.</td>
    <td>Visuals are impeccably designed, clearly explained, and consistently used to enhance the speaker's message rather than distract from it. Fonts, colors, images, and whitespace are deliberately chosen and arranged in a way that is not only effective, but pleasing to the eye. There are no typos.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Questions & Answers (20%)</th>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Speaker lacks ability to answer questions or even understand them, cannot elaborate on any ideas discussed in the presentation, and does not display good understanding of the material.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions with some confidence, but their answers may be inaccurate, contradictory, misleading, or very difficult to understand.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions accurately, but not effectively â€” doesn't seem to anticipate confusion or realize why the question was posed.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions accurately and effectively with little trouble formulating responses.</td>
    <td>Speaker can answer questions accurately and confidently and even elaborate; if the speaker is unsure they can speculate thoughtfully without posing speculation as fact.</td>

In addition to the presentation quality, presenters may also be judged on the [content](./rubric_reasoning.md) of their presentations.
