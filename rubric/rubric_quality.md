  <tr>
    <td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Code is difficult to read and understand due to many issues that affects readability. Code is also poorly organized.<br></br> No effort has been made to reduce code repetition. Tests are absent.</td>
    <td>Code is fairly readable but not very easy to understand. Sufficient and proper commenting/documentation is missing. A few non-reoccurring, and at most two reoccurring issues exist that affect readability.<br></br> Multiple issues with code repetition exist, and several tests are absent and/or are of poor efficacy</td>
    <td>Code is generally easy to read and understand with few non-reoccurring issues and at most one reoccurring issue that affects readability. <br></br> Some form of re-occuring code repetition exists, or tests efficacy is poor. </td>
    <td>Code is easy to read and understand with only 1-2 minor and non-reoccurring issues that affect readability. <br></br> Code repetition is mostly minimized and effective tests are present for most functions.</td>
    <td>Code readability is exceptional and code functionality is unambiguous.<br></br> For example, variable names are clear and self-documenting, an appropriate amount of whitespace is used to maximize visibility, tabs and spaces are not mixed for indentation, sufficient comments are given.<br></br> All functions have proper documentation (e.g. docstrings in Python). <br></br> Overall, code organization and documentation is impeccable. <br></br>Code repetition is minimized via the use of loops/mapping functions, functions or classes or scripts/files as needed without becoming overly complicated. <br></br> Functions are short, concise, and cohesive without losing clarity; code can be easily modified. <br></br> Tests are present to ensure functions work as expected. Exceptions are caught and thrown if necessary (Once students have learned about exceptions).</td>
