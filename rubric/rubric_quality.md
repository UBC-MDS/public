	<td>Did not attempt</td>
	<td> Code is difficult to read and understand due to many issues that affects readability. Code is also poorly organized.
    	<td>Code is generally easy to read and understand with few non-reoccurring issues and at most two reoccurring issue that affects readability. </td>
    	<td>Code is generally easy to read and understand with few non-reoccurring issues and at most one reoccurring issue that affects readability. </td>
    	<td>Code is easy to read and understand with only 1-2 minor and non-reoccurring issues that affect readability. </td>
    	<td>Code is exceptionally easy to read and understand.<br></br> For example, variable names are clear, an appropriate amount of whitespace is used to maximize visibility, tabs and spaces are not mixed for indentation, sufficient comments are given.<br></br> Any coding sections of the assignment that were not completed have documentation explaining what a coded solution would look like. <br></br> Overall, the code is extremely well organized and documented.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Robustness and Maintainability (50%)</th>
	<td>Did not attempt</td>
    	<td>No effort has been made to reduce code repetition. Tests are absent.</td>
	<td>Multiple issues with code repetition exist, and several tests are absent and/or are of poor efficacy</td>
	<td>Some form of re-occuring code repetition exists, or tests efficacy is poor. </td>
	<td>Code repetition is mostly minimized and effective tests are present for most functions.</td>
    	<td>Code repetition is minimized via the use of loops/mapping functions, functions or classes or scripts/files as needed without becoming overly complicated. <br></br> Functions are short, concise, and cohesive without losing clarity; code can be easily modified. <br></br> Tests are present to ensure functions work as expected. Exceptions are caught and thrown if necessary (Once students have learned about exceptions).</td>
