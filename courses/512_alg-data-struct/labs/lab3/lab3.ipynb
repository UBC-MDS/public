    "##### Representing a social network as a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph or network represents relationships among things. The things are represented as _vertices_ (aka _nodes_), and the relationships are represented as _edges_.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use for a graph is to represent travel possibilities, such as on a road map or airline map. The nodes of the graph are cities, and the edges show which cities are directly connected. Then, you can use the graph to plan travel. The graph below represents the social network in Romeo & Juliet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](romeo-and-juliet-undirected.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An edge between person A and person B means that A considers B a friend, and also B considers A a friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph is unable to represent certain information. For example, Count Paris wishes to wed Juliet, but she does not reciprocate his affection. To represent this, we would need a _directed graph_. You do not need to worry about this for this assignment; in any case; social network sites like Facebook do not represent this information either. (Some other social networking sites, such as Twitter and Google+, do permit one-way links.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, ignore the gray background and the labels for the families (\"houses\"); those are there just to help you interpret the graph but are not part of the social network itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting measure in a social network graph is the \"distance\" or number of \"degrees of separation\" between two people. This notion is used in academic research via the [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) and in the film industry via the [Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers). For example, in the above graph, the distance between Juliet and Romeo is 1, and the distance between Juliet and Paris is 2 (via Capulet).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Representing a graph in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/) library to represent a graph in Python. We suggest you work through the [NetworkX tutorial](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/tutorial/index.html), up to and including the \"Accessing edges\" section - but it is not required. If you haven't done the tutorial and get stuck on NetworkX, please consult the tutorial before coming to us!"

    "The `networkx` library can also [be used to give you the adjacency matrix of the graph](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/reference/generated/networkx.linalg.graphmatrix.adjacency_matrix.html). As the documentation shows, this is returned as a SciPy sparse matrix. What is the space complexity of this adjacency matrix, as a function of the number of vertices $V$ and/or the number of edges $E$? What if you used a dense matrix representation? Test this out empirically for the Romeo and Juliet data. For a SciPy sparse matrix `x`, you can get its size in bytes with `x.data.nbytes`, and for a NumPy array `y` you can get its size in bytes with `y.nbytes`. You can convert a sparse matrix `x` to a dense matrix with `x.toarray()`. How many bytes do you think the dense form of the Facebook adjacency matrix would take? (If you try it, you will almost certainly run out of memory)."

Note: if multiple neighbours of an un-infected node are infected, repeat this step multiple times. For example, if Mercutio and Paris like _Gangnam Style_, then Escalus has two chances of being infected at the current time step. Mathematically, the probability of infection is $1-(1-\\xi)^2 = 2\\xi-\\xi^2$, but you don't need to calculate this in your code because you can just repeatedly try to infect the person.\n",

    "Try this for several values of $\\xi$ and investigate how the maximum proportion of infected people depends on $\\xi$. Is the relationship fairly linear or is there a sharp transition? Do your results depend significantly on the structure of the graph? For example, if you randomly remove half of the edges in the Facebook graph (be careful not to delete any vertices in the process!), what is the effect on the virality? \n",
